# Sinusoids
Before you begin, open a new script and define the variables A1, A2, f, theta1, t0, theta2
and group_number according to the table provided to you. As you are completing the steps,
set the names of the variables time_shift, phase_shift_1, phase_shift_2, amp
and ang exactly as they are given. Do not name them differently, as they are going to be
used during grading. Other than that, as long as you follow the instructions, you are free to
use any additional variables or functions you would like.
